#An exploration of Halloween candy sales.
![](./halloween.jpg)
###Purpose
To examine candy sales patterns in Canada and the USA and explore a limited set of potential consequences.

###Canadian candy patterns
```{r, data Canada}
#read basic sales data ####
candy <-read.csv("data/canada/canadian.candy.sales.csv")
library(tibble)
candy <- as_data_frame(candy)
candy
candy$year <-as.factor(candy$year) #need to assign as ordinal so set as factor

#Data viz first to 'see' patterns####
library(ggplot2)
p1 <-ggplot(candy) +geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(year, candy.sales)) + coord_flip()
p1 #ok but this is annual candy sales. I want just october. Might be cool to think about whether candy sales are going up in general every year not just at Halloween.
#now, need to extract just Halloween.
#note, sales end on first of month, so need to take just Nov 1 from each year.
library(dplyr)
octobers <- candy %>% filter(month == 11)
octobers #ok so now I think I have just Halloween sales.
p2 <-ggplot(octobers) +geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(year, candy.sales)) + coord_flip()
p2 #weird as do not have means per month, so going to switch to point plots

p3 <-ggplot(octobers) +geom_point(mapping = aes(year, candy.sales))
p3 #OK this looks a lot better to me
octobers$year <- as.numeric(octobers$year)

p4 <-ggplot(octobers, aes(year, candy.sales)) + geom_point()
p4 +geom_smooth()
p4 + ylab("candy sales")

#so, looks to me like candy sales in oct went up over time. time for a model?
#next step, check distribution of candy sales
p5 <-ggplot(octobers) + geom_histogram(aes(candy.sales)) #changing binwidth crashes it.
p5

#linear model to exlore potential patterns####
m1 <- lm(candy.sales ~year, data= octobers)
summary(m1) #both intercept and slope of line significant different from 0
anova(m1, test="Chisq") #year effect is significant.

#weak but not bad.
#now what about controlling for the background annual candy sales
candy$year <- as.factor(candy$year)
annual.sales <-candy %>% group_by(year) %>% summarise(mean = mean(candy.sales))
annual.sales

octobers<- mutate(octobers, weighted = (octobers$candy.sales/annual.sales$mean))

p5 <-ggplot(octobers, aes(year, weighted)) + geom_point()
p5 +geom_smooth(method=lm)

p6 <- ggplot(octobers) + geom_histogram(aes(weighted))
p6

m2 <- lm(weighted ~year, data= octobers)
summary(m2)
anova(m2, test="Chisq")

#Interpretation.####
#Candy sales at Halloween increasing over time. However, per annum candy sales also increasing. We just buy more candy year round!

#Now, need to read in associated data including number of Canadian children at trick-or-treating age, onset of health issues for same-aged children in Canada, and total sugar consumption per person.

```

###USA candy patterns
Hack in here before Oct 31, 2016 :)!
Data from National Confectionary Association and USA spending patterns summarised by Statistica in appropriate folder on [Github](https://github.com/cjlortie/halloweenR).
